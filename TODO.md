- [x] when users are submitting their bank number and bank code/name, create a referral so that you can transfer to them buddy
- [ ] when uploading a new image anywhere, delete the former, this logic should be done with the upload compoents
- [x] create the schema for payment
- [x] create payment logic
- [ ] cards in username page are too large for mobile
- [x] FAQ page is actually really needed - the data should be dynamic and stored in the data folder, so like a new file, data.ts, and return an array of question and answer type, the faq file has already been created in /app/(marketing)/FAQ/page.tsx, shadcn component will be preferred
